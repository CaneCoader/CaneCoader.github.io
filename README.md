Things to fix
1. links to discord and google calendar do not work since i have no idea hwo they worked when i copied the html
2. the discord widget is to a random server I made, so it needs to be replaced with the proper server. don't replace the entire iframe, only the href, since i added my own css settings
3. I would like to embed the instagram MAPs profile onto the blog. Delete the sample text
4. The website needs to be updated with the new maps room and a link to the location of the new Maps room on Monash wayfinder. 

Things to consider
1. every link and image does not have a leading forward slash. E.g "img/image.png", is used instead of "/img/image.png" since the latter doesn't work for me, Stackoverflow says having "/" is better, so you may change it.
