				<h2>what-is-competitive-programming?</h2>
				<div>
					<p class = "quote">
						Competitive programming is a mind sport involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications.
						<br>
						- Wikipedia.com
					</p>
					<p>
						In a competitive programming contest, coders need to create short applications that can solve mathematical problems algorithmically.
						The algorithm must yield correct results, and must adhere to time and space limits.
						<br><br>
						Here is an example of a basic competitive programming question:
						<br>
					</p>
					<p class = "text-art">____________________________
| Given a natural number,i |
| find the value of the    |
| ith prime number.        |
|__________________________|</p>
					<p>
						Whilst competitive programming is a big focus of what we do, we also hold other types of "algorithms and problem solving" events and activities.

					<p>The main events we hold are:</p>

				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapse"><p>Beginner Competitive Programming Workshops</p></button>
				<div>
					<p>
						If you know the basics of python or other language, but have 
						never heard of competitive programming, these are perfect for you!
						 These workshops will go from the very basics of competitive programming to
						  interesting intermediate topics, giving you a
						foundation to develop on your own and compete in our competitions.
					</p>
					<p>As of Feb 2024, these are held at 4:00pm Thursday at <a href ="https://maps.monash.edu/#v=1&zlevel=1&center=145.129478,-37.909311&zoom=20.3&campusid=159&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=1229645" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> BG15 Science Portables </a></p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapse"><p>Weekly Competition Training Sessions</p></button>
				<div>
					<p>If you're already 
						familiar competitive programming, or you've gotten bored 
						with our workshops, you can do virtual
						 competitions where we cover harder topics and train for the ICPC.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapse"><p>University Competitions</p></button>
				<div>
					<p>Throughout the 
						year we hold large scale competitions with cash prizes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The largest competition is our annual MCPC competition, but various beginner and intermediate competitions 
						are also held.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="collapse"><p>Inter-University Events</p></button>
				<div>
					<p>
						The ICPC, alongside inter-uni collaborations may also occur. We also participate in various <a href = "https://sppcontests.org/anzac-contests/" rel = "noopener" target="_blank">ANZAC</a>
						competitions which occur in preparation for ICPC.
